# NodeJS API - Backend written on NodeJS with express #


When I was learning new stuff that is shown in [that repo](https://github.com/Amaksik/AngularJS_Playbook)
I faced next problem: I need a place to store my data.
Therefore I've learned basics of NodeJS to make an easy API on javascript


*Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment  
that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.*

*Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js,  
released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.  
It is designed for building web applications and APIs.*
